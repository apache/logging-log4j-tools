= Release instructions

[WARNING]
====
In the code examples below, assuming the version to be released is `7.8.0`.
====

== Stage the release

. Create and push the release branch:
+
[source,bash]
----
git fetch -p
git checkout -B release/7.8.0 origin/main
git push origin release/7.8.0
----
. Verify that the associated https://github.com/apache/{repository-name}/actions[GitHub Actions workflow] succeeds:
.. `revision` property in `pom.xml` is updated
.. Changelog is released (i.e., `src/changelog/7.8.0` folder is populated)
.. *Signed artifacts* are uploaded to the _Staging Repositories_ in https://repository.apache.org/[repository.apache.org]
.. *Signed distribution and its checksum* (e.g., `apache-{project-name}-7.8.0-{bin,src}.{zip,.zip.asc,.zip.sha512}`) are uploaded to https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/logging/log4j[dist.apache.org/repos/dist/**dev**/logging/log4j] Subversion repository (along with auxiliary files; email texts, etc.)

+
If not, commit necessary fixes, push, and repeat.

+
[TIP]
====
GitHub Actions workflow is idempotent.
You can iterate on the `release/7.8.0` branch to perfect it.
====
. _Close_ the repository in https://repository.apache.org/[repository.apache.org]

== Vote the release

. Send the vote email uploaded to the https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/logging/log4j[dist.apache.org/repos/dist/**dev**/logging/log4j] Subversion repository
+
[WARNING]
====
**Fix the cited https://repository.apache.org[repository.apache.org] URL** in the generated email!
It changes after every Nexus deployment.
====
+
[WARNING]
====
Make sure your email is sent in plain text, that is, https://infra.apache.org/contrib-email-tips#nohtml[no HTML]!
If you are using GMail, simply enable the _"Plain text mode"_ while composing your message.
====

. Once the consensus is reached within the set time frame, respond to the first post in the thread as follows:
+
[source]
----
Adding my +1.

With that, the release passes with 3 binding +1 votes from <PMC-member-1>, ..., <PMC-member-N>, and me.
I will continue the release process.
----

== Publish the release

=== In the git repository

. Pull the most recent changes and tags
+
[source,bash]
----
git fetch -p
----
. Tag the release (e.g., `rel/7.8.0`) and push it
+
[source,bash]
----
git tag -a rel/7.8.0 <COMMIT-ID> -m 7.8.0     # <1>
git push origin rel/7.8.0
----
+
<1> You can find the `COMMIT-ID` in the generated vote email.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The ASF infrastructure treats ``rel/``-prefixed git tags special and ensures they are immutable for provenance reasons.
====
. Merge `release/7.8.0` to `main`
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout main
git merge release/7.8.0
----
. Set the revision property to the next development version (e.g., `7.9.0-SNAPSHOT`) in xref:pom.xml[`pom.xml`]
. Commit changes and push the `main` branch
. Delete the local and remote copies of the `release/7.8.0` branch

=== In the ASF infrastructure

. _Release_ the repository in https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?logging[repository.apache.org]
. In https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/logging/{project-name}[dist.apache.org/repos/dist] Subversion repository,
.. create the `*release*/logging/{project-name}/7.8.0` folder, and copy the signed sources and their checksum from `*dev*/logging/{project-name}` to there
.. delete the folder from an earlier release in `*release*/logging/{project-name}` (stash the generated announcement email somewhere, you will need it later on)
.. commit changes
. Report the release at https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?logging[reporter.apache.org]

=== In GitHub

Once the artifacts are visible in https://central.sonatype.dev/[central.sonatype.dev], https://github.com/apache/{repository-name}/releases/new[create a new release in GitHub]

. Use the `rel/7.8.0` tag
. Copy release notes from the generated emails

== Announce the release

. Send the announcement email uploaded to the https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/logging/{project-name}[dist.apache.org/repos/dist/**dev**/logging/{project-name}] Subversion repository
+
