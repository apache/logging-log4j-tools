= Release instructions

[WARNING]
====
In the code examples below, assuming the version to be released is `7.8.0`.
====

== Stage the release artifacts

. Checkout the release branch: `git checkout -B release/7.8.0 origin/master`
. Perform and commit following changes:
.. Set the `revision` property to `7.8.0` in xref:pom.xml[`pom.xml`]
.. Update the version and date in xref:CHANGELOG.adoc[`CHANGELOG.adoc`]
. Make sure that `./mvnw clean verify` succeeds â€“ if not, commit necessary fixes
. Push the `release/7.8.0` branch
. Make sure the associated https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j-tools/actions[GitHub Actions workflow] succeeds:
.. *Signed artifacts* are uploaded to the _Staging Repositories_ in https://repository.apache.org/[repository.apache.org]
.. *Signed sources and their checksum* are uploaded as GitHub Actions workflow artifacts
.. `*rel/7.8.0-rc1*` git tag should be created
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The ASF infrastructure treats ``rel/``-prefixed git tags special and ensures they are immutable for provenance reasons.
To make the above operation idempotent and allow retries, the release candidate enumeration used in the tag will be incremented automatically; `rel/7.8.0-rc1`, `rel/7.8.0-rc2`, etc.
====

+
If not, commit necessary fixes, push, and repeat.
. _Close_ the repository in https://repository.apache.org/[repository.apache.org]
. Commit _the signed sources and their checksum_ (e.g., `apache-log4j-tools-7.8.0-src.{zip,.zip.asc,.zip.sha512}`) to https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/logging/log4j[dist.apache.org/repos/dist/**dev**/logging/log4j] Subversion repository and delete any artifacts from old releases
