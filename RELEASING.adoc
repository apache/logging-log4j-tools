.. *Signed artifacts* are uploaded to the _Staging Repositories_ in https://repository.apache.org/[repository.apache.org]
.. *Signed sources and their checksum* are uploaded as GitHub Actions workflow artifacts

+
If not, commit necessary fixes, push, and repeat.
. _Close_ the repository in https://repository.apache.org/[repository.apache.org]
. Commit _the signed sources and their checksum_ (e.g., `apache-log4j-tools-7.8.0-src.{zip,.zip.asc,.zip.sha512}`) to https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/logging/log4j[dist.apache.org/repos/dist/**dev**/logging/log4j] Subversion repository and delete any artifacts from old releases

== Publish the release

=== In the git repository

. Pull the most recent changes and tags
. Tag the release (e.g., `rel/7.8.0`) and push it
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The ASF infrastructure treats ``rel/``-prefixed git tags special and ensures they are immutable for provenance reasons.
====
. If you have committed any fixes to `release/7.8.0`, `cherry-pick` them onto `master`
. Set the revision property to the next development version (e.g., `7.9.0-SNAPSHOT`) in xref:pom.xml[`pom.xml`]
. Commit changes and push the `master` branch
. Delete the local and remote copies of the `release/7.8.0` branch

=== In the ASF infrastructure

. _Release_ the repository in https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?logging[repository.apache.org]
. In https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/logging/log4j[dist.apache.org/repos/dist] Subversion repository,
.. move the signed sources and their checksum from `*dev*/logging/log4j` directory to `*release*/logging/log4j-tools/7.8.0`
.. delete the folder from an earlier release in `*release*/logging/log4j-tools`
.. commit changes
. Report the release at https://reporter.apache.org/[reporter.apache.org]

=== In GitHub

Once the artifacts are visible in https://central.sonatype.dev/[central.sonatype.dev], https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j-tools/releases/new[create a new release in GitHub]

. Use the `rel/7.8.0` tag
. Copy release notes from the generated `target/generated-sources/site/changelog/7.8.0.md`
