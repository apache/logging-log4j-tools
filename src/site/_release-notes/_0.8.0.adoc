    IF THIS FILE DOESN'T HAVE A `.ftl` SUFFIX, IT IS AUTO-GENERATED, DO NOT EDIT IT!

    Version-specific release notes (`7.8.0.adoc`, etc.) are generated from `src/changelog/*/.release-notes.adoc.ftl`.
    Auto-generation happens during `generate-sources` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Find and edit the associated `.release-notes.adoc.ftl`
    2. Run `./mvnw generate-sources`
    3. Commit both `.release-notes.adoc.ftl` and the generated `7.8.0.adoc`

[#release-notes-0-8-0]
=== 0.8.0

Release date:: 2024-03-19

This release delivers the first version of Log4j Docgen (Documentation Generator).
It is a set of tools to auto-generate the Log4j plugin documentation (to be integrated into the website) and the Log4j configuration XSD file (for assisting the configuration of the Log4j runtime, i.e., `log4j2.xml`) from the Log4j source code.
See the project website for details.

==== Changed

* Move Log4j Changelog XML namespace and schema location to `https://logging.apache.org/xml/ns` and `https://logging.apache.org/xml/ns/log4j-changelog-0.xsd`, respectively

==== Removed

* Remove `author` from Log4j Changelog.

It was yet another bit to maintain and created role-related (who did what) problems.
Many modern software projects use a VCS (e.g., Git) and support services (e.g., GitHub) which make it trivial to trace back the origin of a change using commit and issue IDs.
