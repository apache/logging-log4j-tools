= Log4j Changelog Maven Plugin

This project ships a Maven plugin providing access to the `ChangelogExporter` and `ChangelogReleaser` of xref:log4j-changelog.adoc[Log4j Changelog].

[#dependencies]
== Dependencies

You need to have the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-changelog-maven-plugin` dependency in your classpath:

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>log4j-changelog-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>{project-version}</version>
</plugin>
----

[#export]
== Exporting changelogs

_Exporting_ changelogs is the act of feeding provided changelog and release information into {freemarker-link} templates to generate certain files; e.g., release notes for the website.
There are two types template files supported:

xref:log4j-changelog.adoc#changelog-template[Changelog templates]::
These templates are rendered with the release and changelog information of a particular release.
These are generally used to generate release notes for a particular release.

xref:log4j-changelog.adoc#index-template[Index templates]::
These templates are rendered with the release information of all releases.
These are generally used to generate the index page referencing to release notes of each release.

See xref:#export[the Log4j Changelog documentation] for further details.

You can use the `export` goal as follows:

.`build > plugins` block entry of `pom.xml`
[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<!-- Export AsciiDoc-formatted release notes -->
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>log4j-changelog-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>{project-version}</version>
  <inherited>false</inherited>
  <configuration>
    <indexTemplates>
      <template>
        <source>.index.adoc.ftl</source>
      </template>
    </indexTemplates>
    <changelogTemplates>
      <template>
        <source>.release-notes.adoc.ftl</source>
        <target>%v.adoc</target>
      </template>
    </changelogTemplates>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>generate-changelog</id>
      <goals>
        <goal>export</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----

`export` goal by default runs during the `pre-site` phase and accepts the following configuration:

`skip` (parameter)::
Indicates if the execution should be skipped or not.
It defaults to `false` and can be set using the `log4j.changelog.skip` property.

`changelogDirectory` (parameter)::
Directory containing release folders composed of changelog entry XML files.
It defaults to `${project.basedir}/src/changelog` and can be set using the `log4j.changelog.directory` property.

`outputDirectory` (parameter)::
Directory to write rendered templates.
It defaults to `${project.build.directory}/generated-sources/site/changelog` and can be set using the `log4j.changelog.exporter.outputDirectory` property.

`indexTemplates` (parameter)::
List of xref:#export-template-type[template]s that will be rendered with release information of all releases.
See xref:log4j-changelog.adoc#index-template[the index template file documentation] for details.

`changelogTemplates` (parameter)::
List of xref:#export-template-type[template]s that will be rendered with release and changelog information of a particular release.
See xref:log4j-changelog.adoc#changelog-template[the changelog template file documentation] for details.

[#export-template-type]
`Template` (type)::
An object composed of following fields:
+
`source` (parameter):::
the {freemarker-link} template file

`target` (parameter):::
The output file.
If not provided, it will be derived from the `source`: if the `source` is `.index.adoc.ftl`, the `target` will be set to `index.adoc`.
If the value contains a `%v` (e.g., `%v.adoc`), it will be replaced with the associated release version.
`%v` substitution is only allowed for changelog templates and will not work for index templates.

`failIfNotFound` (parameter):::
Indicates if export should fail when the source cannot be found.
Defaults to `false`.

[#release]
== Populating a release changelog directory

You can use the `release` goal wrapping xref:log4j-changelog.adoc#qa-deploy-release[`ChangelogReleaser` to populate a release changelog directory].
An example usage is shared below.

.Populate `src/changelog/2.19.0` from `src/changelog/.2.x.x`
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw -N log4j-changelog:release -Dlog4j.changelog.releaseVersion=2.19.0
----

Note that above we are using `-N` (`--non-recursive`) to avoid visiting submodules, which also makes the run faster.

`release` goal does not have default phase and accepts the following configuration parameters:

`skip` (parameter)::
Indicates if the execution should be skipped or not.
It defaults to `false` and can be set using the `log4j.changelog.skip` property.

`changelogDirectory` (parameter)::
Directory containing release folders composed of changelog entry XML files.
It defaults to `${project.basedir}/src/changelog` and can be set using the `log4j.changelog.directory` property.

`releaseVersion` (parameter)::
The version to be released.
It can be set using the `log4j.changelog.releaseVersion` property.

`versionPattern` (parameter)::
The regular expression pattern for parsing versions.
The pattern must provide the following named groups: `major`, `minor`, and `patch`.
It defaults to `^(?<major>0|[1-9]\d*)\.(?<minor>0|[1-9]\d*)\.(?<patch>0|[1-9]\d*(-[a-zA-Z][0-9a-zA-Z-]*)?)$` and can be set using the `log4j.changelog.versionPattern` property.
