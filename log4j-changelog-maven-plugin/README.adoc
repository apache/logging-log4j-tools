This project ships a Maven plugin providing convenient access to the `ChangelogExporter` and `ChangelogReleaser` of xref:../log4j-changelog/README.adoc[log4j-changelog].

[#export]
== Exporting changelogs

You can use the `export` goal to export a changelog directory (e.g., `src/changelog`) using provided templates (i.e., `.index.adoc.ftl` and `.changelog.adoc.ftl`) and generate `index.adoc`, `2.18.0.adoc`, `2.19.0.adoc`, etc.
An example usage is shared below.

.Export AsciiDoc-formatted release notes to `target/generated-sources/site/asciidoc/changelog`
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw -N log4j-changelog:export
----

Note that above we are using `-N` (`--non-recursive`) to avoid visiting submodules, which also makes the run faster.

`export` goal by default runs during the `pre-site` phase and accepts the following configuration parameters:

`changelogDirectory`::
Directory containing release folders composed of changelog entry XML files.
It defaults to `${project.basedir}/src/changelog` and can be set using the `log4j.changelog.directory` property.

`outputDirectory`::
Directory to write generated changelog files.
It defaults to `${project.build.directory}/generated-sources/site/asciidoc/changelog` and can be set using the `log4j.changelog.exporter.outputDirectory` property.

[#release]
== Populating a release changelog directory

You can use the `release` goal wrapping xref:../log4j-changelog/README.adoc#qa-deploy-release[`ChangelogReleaser` to populate a release changelog directory].
An example usage is shared below.

.Populate `src/changelog/2.19.0` from `src/changelog/.2.x.x`
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw -N log4j-changelog:release -Dlog4j.changelog.releaseVersion=2.19.0
----

Note that above we are using `-N` (`--non-recursive`) to avoid visiting submodules, which also makes the run faster.

`release` goal does not have default phase and accepts the following configuration parameters:

`changelogDirectory`::
Directory containing release folders composed of changelog entry XML files.
It defaults to `${project.basedir}/src/changelog` and can be set using the `log4j.changelog.directory` property.

`releaseVersion`::
The version to be released.
It can be set using the `log4j.changelog.releaseVersion` property.
