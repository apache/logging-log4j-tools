[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_layout_JsonLayout]
= JsonLayout

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.layout.JsonLayout`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`


Note: The JsonLayout should be considered to be deprecated.

Please use JsonTemplateLayout instead.
Appends a series of JSON events as strings serialized as bytes.

== Additional Fields

If you configure `complete="true"`, the appender outputs a well-formed JSON document.
By default, with `complete="false"`, you should include the output as an _external file_ in a separate file to form a well-formed JSON document.

If `complete="false"`, the appender does not write the JSON open array character "[" at the start of the document, "]" and the end, nor comma "," between records.

Appenders using this layout should have their `charset` set to `UTF-8` or `UTF-16`, otherwise events containing non ASCII characters could result in corrupted log files.

By default, the JSON layout is not compact (a.k.a. "pretty") with `compact="false"`, which means the appender uses end-of-line characters and indents lines to format the text.
If `compact="true"`, then no end-of-line or indentation is used.
Message content may contain, of course, escaped end-of-lines.

This property allows addition of custom fields into generated JSON.
`<JsonLayout><KeyValuePair key="foo" value="bar"/></JsonLayout>` inserts `"foo":"bar"` directly into JSON output.
Supports Lookup expressions.
