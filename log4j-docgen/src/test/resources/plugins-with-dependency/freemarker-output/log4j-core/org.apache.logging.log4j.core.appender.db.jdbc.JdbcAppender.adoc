[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_appender_db_jdbc_JdbcAppender]
= JDBC

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.db.jdbc.JdbcAppender`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`

This Appender writes logging events to a relational database using standard JDBC mechanisms.

It takes a list of xref:ColumnConfig.adoc[]s and/or xref:ColumnMapping.adoc[]s with which it determines how to save the event data into the appropriate columns in the table.
ColumnMapping is new as of Log4j 2.8 and supports xref:TypeConverter.adoc[] and persistence using xref:PreparedStatement.adoc[]. A xref:ConnectionSource.adoc[] plugin instance instructs the appender (and xref:JdbcDatabaseManager.adoc[]) how to connect to the database.
This appender can be reconfigured at run time.
