[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_layout_XmlLayout]
= XmlLayout

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.layout.XmlLayout`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`

Appends a series of `event` elements as defined in the log4j.
dtd.

== Additional Fields

If you configure `complete="true"`, the appender outputs a well-formed XML document where the default namespace is the log4j namespace . By default, with `complete="false"`, you should include the output as an _external entity_ in a separate file to form a well-formed XML document.

If `complete="false"`, the appender does not write the XML processing instruction and the root element.

Appenders using this layout should have their `charset` set to `UTF-8` or `UTF-16`, otherwise events containing non-ASCII characters could result in corrupted log files.

By default, the XML layout is not compact (compact = not "pretty") with `compact="false"`, which means the appender uses end-of-line characters and indents lines to format the XML.
If `compact="true"`, then no end-of-line or indentation is used.
Message content may contain, of course, end-of-lines.

This property allows addition of custom fields into generated JSON.
`<XmlLayout><KeyValuePair key="foo" value="bar"/></XmlLayout>` inserts `<foo>bar</foo>` directly into XML output.
Supports Lookup expressions.
