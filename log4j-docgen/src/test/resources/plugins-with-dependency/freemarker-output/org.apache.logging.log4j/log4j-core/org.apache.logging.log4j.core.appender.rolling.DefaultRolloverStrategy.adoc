[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_appender_rolling_DefaultRolloverStrategy]
= DefaultRolloverStrategy

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.rolling.DefaultRolloverStrategy`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`

When rolling over, `DefaultRolloverStrategy` renames files according to an algorithm as described below.

The DefaultRolloverStrategy is a combination of a time-based policy and a fixed-window policy.
When the file name pattern contains a date format then the rollover time interval will be used to calculate the time to use in the file pattern.
When the file pattern contains an integer replacement token one of the counting techniques will be used.

When the ascending attribute is set to true (the default) then the counter will be incremented and the current log file will be renamed to include the counter value.
If the counter hits the maximum value then the oldest file, which will have the smallest counter, will be deleted, all other files will be renamed to have their counter decremented and then the current file will be renamed to have the maximum counter value.
Note that with this counting strategy specifying a large maximum value may entirely avoid renaming files.

When the ascending attribute is false, then the "normal" fixed-window strategy will be used.

Let _max_ and _min_ represent the values of respectively the *MaxIndex* and *MinIndex* options.
Let "foo.
log" be the value of the *ActiveFile* option and "foo.
%i.log" the value of *FileNamePattern*. Then, when rolling over, the file `foo. _max_.log` will be deleted, the file `foo. _max-1_.log` will be renamed as `foo. _max_.log`, the file `foo. _max-2_.log` renamed as `foo. _max-1_.log`, and so on, the file `foo. _min+1_.log` renamed as `foo. _min+2_.log`. Lastly, the active file `foo. log` will be renamed as `foo. _min_.log` and a new active file name `foo. log` will be created.

Given that this rollover algorithm requires as many file renaming operations as the window size, large window sizes are discouraged.
