[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_appender_routing_RoutingAppender]
= Routing

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.routing.RoutingAppender`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`

This Appender "routes" between various Appenders, some of which can be references to Appenders defined earlier in the configuration while others can be dynamically created within this Appender as required.

Routing is achieved by specifying a pattern on the Routing appender declaration.
The pattern should contain one or more substitution patterns of the form "$${[key:]token}". The pattern will be resolved each time the Appender is called using the built in StrSubstitutor and the StrLookup plugin that matches the specified key.
