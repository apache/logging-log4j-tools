= StrLookup

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.lookup.StrLookup`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`

Lookup a String key to a String value.

This class represents the simplest form of a string to string map.
It has a benefit over a map in that it can create the result on demand based on the key.

This class comes complete with various factory methods.
If these do not suffice, you can subclass and implement your own matcher.

For example, it would be possible to implement a lookup that used the key as a primary key, and looked up the value on demand from the database
