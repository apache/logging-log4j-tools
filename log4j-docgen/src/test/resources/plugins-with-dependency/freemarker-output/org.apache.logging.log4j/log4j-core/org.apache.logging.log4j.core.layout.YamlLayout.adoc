[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_layout_YamlLayout]
= YamlLayout

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.layout.YamlLayout`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`

Appends a series of YAML events as strings serialized as bytes.

== Additional Fields

Appenders using this layout should have their `charset` set to `UTF-8` or `UTF-16`, otherwise events containing non ASCII characters could result in corrupted log files.

This property allows addition of custom fields into generated JSON.
`<YamlLayout><KeyValuePair key="foo" value="bar"/></YamlLayout>` inserts `foo: "bar"` directly into YAML output.
Supports Lookup expressions.
