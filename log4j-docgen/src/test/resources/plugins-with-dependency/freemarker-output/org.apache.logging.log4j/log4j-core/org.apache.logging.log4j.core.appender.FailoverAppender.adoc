[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_appender_FailoverAppender]
= Failover

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.FailoverAppender`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`

The FailoverAppender will capture exceptions in an Appender and then route the event to a different appender.

Hopefully it is obvious that the Appenders must be configured to not suppress exceptions for the FailoverAppender to work.
