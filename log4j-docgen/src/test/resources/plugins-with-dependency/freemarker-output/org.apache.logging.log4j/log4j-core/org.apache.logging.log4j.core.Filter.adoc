[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_Filter]
= Filter

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.Filter`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`

Interface that must be implemented to allow custom event filtering.

It is highly recommended that applications make use of the Filters provided with this implementation before creating their own.

This interface supports "global" filters (i.e. - all events must pass through them first), attached to specific loggers and associated with Appenders.
It is recommended that, where possible, Filter implementations create a generic filtering method that can be called from any of the filter methods.
