= Type converters

Type converter plugins are used to convert simple `String` values into other types.

[#boolean]
== `boolean`


A boolean value

[#boolean-values]
=== Possible values

`false`:: false
`true`:: true

[#byte]
== `byte`


An 8-bit signed integer from `-128` to `127`

[#double]
== `double`


A double precision floating number from `4.94065645841246544e-324` to `1.79769313486231570e+308`

[#float]
== `float`


A single precision floating number from `1.40239846e-45` to `3.40282347e+38`

[#int]
== `int`


A 32-bit signed integer from `-2147483648` to `2147483647`

[#java_lang_String]
== `java.lang.String`


A string of characters

[#long]
== `long`


A 64-bit signed integer from `-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807`

[#org_apache_logging_log4j_Level]
== `org.apache.logging.log4j.Level`

Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`

Represents a logging level.
NOTE: The Log4j API supports custom levels, the following list contains only the standard ones.

[#org_apache_logging_log4j_Level-values]
=== Possible values

`OFF`:: Special level that disables logging.
No events should be logged at this level.
`FATAL`:: A fatal event that will prevent the application from continuing
`ERROR`:: An error in the application, possibly recoverable
`WARN`:: An event that might possible lead to an error
`INFO`:: An event for informational purposes
`DEBUG`:: A general debugging event
`TRACE`:: A fine-grained debug message, typically capturing the flow through the application
`ALL`:: Special level indicating all events should be logged

[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_Filter_Result]
== `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.Filter.Result`

Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`

The result that can returned from a filter method call.

[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_Filter_Result-values]
=== Possible values

`ACCEPT`:: The event will be processed without further filtering based on the log Level.
`NEUTRAL`:: No decision could be made, further filtering should occur.
`DENY`:: The event should not be processed.

[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_appender_ConsoleAppender_Target]
== `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.ConsoleAppender.Target`

Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`

Specifies the target of a console appender.

[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_appender_ConsoleAppender_Target-values]
=== Possible values

`SYSTEM_OUT`:: Logs to the standard output.
`SYSTEM_ERR`:: Logs to the standard error.

[#short]
== `short`


A 16-bit signed integer from `-32768` to `32767`
