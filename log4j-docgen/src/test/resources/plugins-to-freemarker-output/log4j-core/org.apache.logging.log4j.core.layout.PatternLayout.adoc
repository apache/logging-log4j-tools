= PatternLayout

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.layout.PatternLayout`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`

A flexible layout configurable with pattern string.

The goal of this class is to {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.Layout#toByteArray format} a {@link LogEvent} and return the results.
The format of the result depends on the _conversion pattern_.

The conversion pattern is closely related to the conversion pattern of the printf function in C.
A conversion pattern is composed of literal text and format control expressions called _conversion specifiers_.
