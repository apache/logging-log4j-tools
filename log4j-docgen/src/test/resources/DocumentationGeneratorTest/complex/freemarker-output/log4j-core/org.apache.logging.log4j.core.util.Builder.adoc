[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_util_Builder]
= `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.util.Builder`

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.util.Builder`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`


A type of builder that can be used to configure and create a instances using a Java DSL instead of through a configuration file.

These builders are primarily useful for internal code and unit tests, but they can technically be used as a verbose alternative to configuration files.

When creating _plugin_ builders, it is customary to create the builder class as a public static inner class called `Builder`. For instance, the builder class for xref:org.apache.logging.log4j.core.layout.PatternLayout.adoc[PatternLayout] would be `PatternLayout. Builder`.
