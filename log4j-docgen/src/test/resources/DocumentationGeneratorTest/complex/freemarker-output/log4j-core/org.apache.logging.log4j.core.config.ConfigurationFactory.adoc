[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_config_ConfigurationFactory]
= `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config.ConfigurationFactory`

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config.ConfigurationFactory`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`


Factory class for parsed xref:Configuration.adoc[] objects from a configuration file.

ConfigurationFactory allows the configuration implementation to be dynamically chosen in 1 of 3 ways:

. A system property named "log4j.
configurationFactory" can be set with the name of the ConfigurationFactory to be used.
. xref:.adoc[] can be called with the instance of the ConfigurationFactory to be used.
This must be called before any other calls to Log4j.
. A ConfigurationFactory implementation can be added to the classpath and configured as a plugin in the xref:.adoc[] category.
The xref:Order.adoc[] annotation should be used to configure the factory to be the first one inspected.
See xref:org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config.xml.XmlConfigurationFactory.adoc[XmlConfigurationFactory] for an example.

If the ConfigurationFactory that was added returns null on a call to getConfiguration then any other ConfigurationFactories found as plugins will be called in their respective order.
DefaultConfiguration is always called last if no configuration has been returned.
