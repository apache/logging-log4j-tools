= BurstFilter

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.filter.BurstFilter`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`


The `BurstFilter` is a logging filter that regulates logging traffic.

Use this filter when you want to control the maximum burst of log statements that can be sent to an appender.
The filter is configured in the log4j configuration file.
For example, the following configuration limits the number of INFO level (as well as DEBUG and TRACE) log statements that can be sent to the console to a burst of 100 with an average rate of 16 per second.
WARN, ERROR and FATAL messages would continue to be delivered.
`<Console name="console"> <PatternLayout pattern="%-5p %d{dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm:ss} %x %t %m%n"/> <Filters> <BurstFilter level="INFO" rate="16" maxBurst="100"/> </Filters> </Console>`
