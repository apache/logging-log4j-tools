= SMTP

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.SmtpAppender`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`


Send an e-mail when a specific logging event occurs, typically on errors or fatal errors.

The number of logging events delivered in this e-mail depend on the value of *BufferSize* option.

This keeps memory requirements at a reasonable level while still delivering useful application context.
By default, an email message will formatted as HTML.
This can be modified by setting a layout for the appender.
By default, an email message will be sent when an ERROR or higher severity message is appended.
This can be modified by setting a filter for the appender.
