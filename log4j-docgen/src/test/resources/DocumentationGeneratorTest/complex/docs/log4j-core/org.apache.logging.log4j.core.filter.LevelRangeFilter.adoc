= LevelRangeFilter

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.filter.LevelRangeFilter`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`


This filter returns the xref:.adoc[] result if the level of the apiref:LogEvent[] is in the range of the configured xref:.adoc[] and xref:.adoc[] values, otherwise it returns the xref:.adoc[] result.

The default values for xref:.adoc[] and xref:.adoc[] are set to apiref:Level[] and apiref:Level[], respectively.
The default values for xref:.adoc[] and xref:.adoc[] are set to apiref:Result[] and apiref:Result[], respectively.

The levels get compared by their associated integral values; apiref:Level[] has an integral value of 0, apiref:Level[] 100, xref:Level.adoc[] 200, and so on.
For example, if the filter is configured with xref:.adoc[] set to apiref:Level[], the filter will return xref:.adoc[] result for apiref:LogEvent[]s of level with higher integral values; xref:Level.adoc[], xref:Level.adoc[], etc.
