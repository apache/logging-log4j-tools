[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_appender_rolling_DirectWriteRolloverStrategy]
= DirectWriteRolloverStrategy

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.rolling.DirectWriteRolloverStrategy`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`


When rolling over, `DirectWriteRolloverStrategy` writes directly to the file as resolved by the file pattern.

Files will be renamed files according to an algorithm as described below.

The DirectWriteRolloverStrategy uses similar logic as DefaultRolloverStrategy to determine the file name based on the file pattern, however the DirectWriteRolloverStrategy writes directly to a file and does not rename it during rollover, except if it is compressed, in which case it will add the appropriate file extension.
