= IfFileName

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.rolling.action.IfFileName`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`


PathCondition that accepts files for deletion if their relative path matches either a glob pattern or a regular expression.

If both a regular expression and a glob pattern are specified the glob pattern is used and the regular expression is ignored.

The regular expression is a pattern as defined by the apiref:java.util.regex.Pattern[] class.
A glob is a simplified pattern expression described in apiref:java.nio.file.FileSystem#getPathMatcher(String)[].
