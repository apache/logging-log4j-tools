[#org_apache_logging_log4j_core_layout_GelfLayout]
= GelfLayout

Class:: `org.apache.logging.log4j.core.layout.GelfLayout`
Provider:: `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core`


Lays out events in the Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF) 1.1.

This layout compresses JSON to GZIP or ZLIB (the `compressionType`) if log event data is larger than 1024 bytes (the `compressionThreshold`). This layout does not implement chunking.
