= Appender

Appends log events.
An Appender can contain a `Layout` if applicable as well as an `ErrorHandler`.
Typical Appender implementations coordinate with an implementation of `AbstractManager` to handle external resources such as streams, connections, and other shared state.
As Appenders are plugins, concrete implementations need to be annotated with `@Plugin` and need to provide a static factory method annotated with `@PluginFactory`.

Most core plugins are written using a related Manager class that handle the actual task of serializing a `LogEvent` to some output location.
For instance, many Appenders can take advantage of the `@OutputStreamManager` class.

It is recommended that Appenders don't do any heavy lifting since there can be many instances of the class being used at any given time.
When resources require locking (e.g., through `@FileLock`), it is important to isolate synchronized code to prevent concurrency issues.
